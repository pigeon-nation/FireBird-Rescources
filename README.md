## FireBird-Rescources
***All will be revealed in a week or two***

#### About
This is some code for a website that currently is in development. I am currently busy coding it, however it is going to be (hopefully) ready for deployment soon. When that happens, I will provide a link and some more docs. This repository is incomplete and currently contains not much. This is simply rescource code. View the ACTUAL site repo here: [unavaliable]

#### What is the website on?
The website is all about some code I have written. This GitHub Repo contains mostly code that this website gives tutorials on how to access, and not much more. I could not host it all directly because it would cost me some of the little data I have avalible. 

### Thanks for viewing!! Be sure to check back soon
